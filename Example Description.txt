Extended Description
This repository includes example data and outputs to help users understand the script's functionality and workflow. Below is a description of the provided example files:

Example Files
Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) Cell Border Image:

An example image of segmented RPE cell borders is included to demonstrate the input data format.
This image serves as a visual representation of how the segmentation appears before processing.
Heatmap Outputs:

Example heatmaps generated by the script are included, showcasing the visualization of computed parameters such as:
Hexagonality Score
Aspect Ratio
Circularity
Neighbor Counts
These heatmaps are saved as .png files and demonstrate how the visualizations appear.
Segmented Data File (seq.npy):

An example segmentation file in .npy format is included.
This file is generated by Cellpose and serves as the starting input for the script.
The segmentation file is used to compute all the parameters and generate the heatmaps.
Using the Example Files
Input Data:

Use the provided seq.npy file as the input for the script.
Update the FILEPATH and DATANAME variables in the script to point to this file:
python
Kodu kopyala
FILEPATH = r"path_to_example_data"
DATANAME = "example_segmentation"
Expected Outputs:

Heatmaps similar to the provided examples will be generated for:
Hexagonality Score
Aspect Ratio
Circularity
Area, Perimeter, and more
The results will be saved in the working directory as .png files.
A comprehensive .xlsx file containing all computed parameters will be created.
Visualization:

Compare the output heatmaps and Excel data with the included example files to ensure the script is functioning correctly.
Purpose of Example Files

The example files are provided to:

Help users understand the expected input format and outputs.
Offer a reference for validating the script's results.
Demonstrate the practical application of the script in analyzing RPE cells.
